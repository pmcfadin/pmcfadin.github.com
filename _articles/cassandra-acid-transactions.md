At Cassandra Summit 2023, I had the privilege of presenting one of the most significant developments in Apache Cassandra's history: full ACID transaction support. This isn't just another feature - it's a fundamental shift that addresses one of the longest-standing requests from the Cassandra community.

## Why ACID Matters in Distributed Systems

For years, the database world has operated under the assumption that you must choose between consistency and availability. Cassandra traditionally optimized for availability and partition tolerance, following the AP side of the CAP theorem. But what if you didn't have to choose?

ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions have been the gold standard for relational databases, ensuring data integrity even in the face of failures. Bringing these guarantees to a distributed, scale-out database like Cassandra seemed impossible - until now.

## The Technical Achievement

Implementing ACID transactions in a masterless, distributed system is extraordinarily complex. The Cassandra community solved this through:

### Accord: A New Consensus Protocol
Instead of traditional two-phase commit or Paxos-based approaches, Cassandra 5.0 introduces Accord, a leaderless transaction protocol that maintains Cassandra's core architectural principles while providing strong consistency guarantees.

### Maintaining Performance at Scale
The beauty of this implementation is that it doesn't sacrifice Cassandra's legendary performance. Transactions are optimized for the common case, with minimal overhead for non-transactional operations.

### Backwards Compatibility
Existing applications continue to work without modification. ACID transactions are opt-in, allowing teams to adopt them gradually as needed.

## Real-World Impact

This changes everything for several use cases:

### Financial Services
Banks and payment processors can now use Cassandra for core transaction processing, not just for auxiliary systems. The combination of global scale and ACID guarantees opens new architectural possibilities.

### Inventory Management
E-commerce platforms can maintain accurate inventory counts across distributed data centers without complex application-level coordination.

### Gaming
Multiplayer games can ensure consistent state updates across player actions without the complexity of eventual consistency reconciliation.

## Developer Experience

The API is surprisingly simple:

```cql
BEGIN TRANSACTION
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 'A';
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 'B';
  INSERT INTO transfers (id, from_account, to_account, amount, timestamp) 
    VALUES (uuid(), 'A', 'B', 100, toTimestamp(now()));
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

This familiar syntax makes it easy for developers coming from relational databases to leverage Cassandra's scale without learning entirely new patterns.

## What's Next

ACID transactions in Cassandra 5.0 represent just the beginning. The foundation laid by Accord opens possibilities for:

- Distributed secondary indexes with strong consistency
- Multi-datacenter transactions with tunable consistency
- Advanced conflict resolution strategies

## The Bottom Line

For years, architects had to choose between scale and consistency. With Cassandra 5.0's ACID transactions, that trade-off is history. You can now build applications that scale globally while maintaining the data integrity guarantees your business requires.

This isn't just an evolution of Cassandra - it's a revolution in what's possible with distributed databases. And yes, this changes everything.
